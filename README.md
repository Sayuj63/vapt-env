# SecurityAuditEnv -- Can Your AI Agent Actually Reason About Security?

**Live Environment:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sayuj63/Vapt-env
**Trained adapter on HF Hub:** https://huggingface.co/Sayuj63/vapt-env-llama32-3b-grpo
**W&B training run:** https://wandb.ai/sayujpillai63-itm/vapt-env-grpo/runs/ln2jq71s
**Training notebook (Colab):** [`AISHA_RL_Training_Colab.ipynb`](./AISHA_RL_Training_Colab.ipynb)
**Headline result:** Llama 3.2 3B average score **0.075 → 0.482** post-GRPO (**6.4× improvement**, real W&B curve, no synthetic data).

A long-horizon, partially-observable enterprise security world where an LLM agent has to **do real reasoning over raw evidence** — not parse labels — and **delegate divergent attack-surface branches to budgeted sub-agents** the moment one tool reveals another. Built to train the three capability gaps current LLMs miss most:

1. **World modeling under partial observability** — hidden hosts, honeypots, evidence that ranges from labeled (`[CRITICAL] SQL Injection, CWE-89`) to fully raw (`POST /login: 1000 reqs in 18.7s, 0 blocked`).
2. **Long-horizon planning with sparse rewards** — 25/35/45-step audits with phase tracking (recon → enumeration → exploitation → reporting) and dense per-step rewards on top of the final multi-dimensional grader.
3. **Multi-agent delegation** — when an SSRF reveals an internal IP, the agent decides: persist on the main thread, or `spawn_subagent` to investigate the new branch with a step budget. Productive sub-agents (≥1 finding) earn +0.05; unproductive ones cost −0.05. The grader credits delegation decision quality as a 5% scoring component.

Most AI security tools parse labeled scanner output. We measure what happens when the labels disappear *and* the attack surface evolves during the audit.

| Difficulty | Agent Sees | Regex Parser | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
|---|---|---|---|
| Easy | `[CRITICAL] SQL Injection, CWE-89, CVSS 9.8` | **1.00** | 0.83 |
| Medium | `Server fetched internal URL via image_url parameter` | 0.07 | **0.43** |
| Hard | `POST /login: 1000 reqs in 18.7s, 0 blocked` | 0.00 | **0.27** |

Same vulnerabilities. Same grader. Three levels of evidence abstraction. The gap between easy and hard IS the frontier of AI security reasoning.

## Why This Matters -- The Numbers

**The asymmetry is getting worse.**  Attackers now break out in **29 minutes** on average -- fastest observed: **27 seconds** (CrowdStrike Global Threat Report 2026). New vulnerabilities are exploited within **5 days** of disclosure, but defenders take **209 days** to patch (Verizon DBIR 2025). **48,185 new CVEs** were published in 2025 alone, up 20% year-over-year (NVD).

**There aren't enough humans.** There are **4.8 million unfilled cybersecurity positions** worldwide (ISC2 2024). **48%** of CISOs cite skilled tester availability as their top obstacle for the third consecutive year (Pentera 2025). **67%** of U.S. enterprises were breached in the past 24 months (Pentera 2025).

**Existing automation doesn't solve it.** Automated vulnerability scanners miss **69--76%** of real vulnerabilities (UPV Academic Study). Only **7%** of organizations currently use AI in cyber defense, even though **88%** plan to (BCG 2025). Pen testers spend **20--60%** of engagement time writing reports instead of finding vulnerabilities (Cyver Core 2025). Only **48%** of pentest findings ever get resolved (Cobalt State of Pentesting 2025).

**The cost of failure is measured.** The average data breach costs **$4.88M** (IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024). Enterprises spend **$187K/year** on penetration testing -- a **$2.7B** global market (Pentera 2025, Fortune Business Insights 2025). But organizations using AI/automation extensively save **$1.9M per breach** and resolve incidents **80 days faster** (IBM 2025).

**The question isn't whether AI will do security testing. It's whether AI can reason from raw evidence like a human auditor -- or only parse labeled output like a regex script.** This environment measures exactly that.

## Architecture

SecurityAuditEnv is built on three subsystems -- no hardcoded scenarios, no static tool output:

```
+----------------------------------------------+
|          VULNERABILITY KNOWLEDGE BASE         |
|  26 vuln types from OWASP Top 10 + CWE       |
|  16 payload sets with real attack patterns    |
|  22 response template sets (3 difficulty tiers)|
|  4 compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS/SOC2/HIPAA) |
+----------------------+-----------------------+
                       |
          +------------v-----------+
          |   SCENARIO GENERATOR   |
          |  seed + difficulty -->  |
          |  topology, services,   |
          |  endpoints + params,   |
          |  vuln placements,      |
          |  attack chains         |
          |  = infinite scenarios  |
          +------------+-----------+
                       |
          +------------v-----------+
          |  TOOL SIMULATION ENGINE |
          |  10 security tools      |
          |  output generated from  |
          |  KB templates + context |
          |  parameter-level testing|
          |  3-tier difficulty      |
          +------------------------+
```

**Knowledge Base** (`server/knowledge_base/`): Vulnerability type definitions sourced from OWASP Top 10 2021 and CWE Top 25. Each type includes CWE IDs, CVSS ranges, attack payloads, response templates for three difficulty tiers, and compliance control mappings. Not hardcoded instances -- reusable templates.

**Scenario Generator** (`server/generator/`): Procedurally generates complete audit scenarios from a seed. Any string works as a scenario ID -- each produces a unique, deterministic network topology with hosts, services, web endpoints (with parameters), vulnerability placements, attack chains, and honeypots. The 3 built-in tasks (easy/medium/hard) are predetermined seeds.

**Tool Simulation Engine** (`server/tools_engine/`): Replaces the old static lookup table. Each tool has a behavior model that generates output from the knowledge base templates filled with scenario context. Testing tools accept an optional `parameter` argument for parameter-level testing.

### Parameter-Level Testing

```python
# Agent discovers endpoints with parameters via web_crawl:
#   POST /api/login — Parameters: username (string), password (string)
#   GET  /api/search — Parameters: q (string), page (int)

# Then tests specific parameters:
result = env.step(SecurityAuditAction(
    action_type="use_tool",
    tool_name="test_injection",
    arguments={"host": "10.0.1.10", "endpoint": "/api/login", "parameter": "username"}
))
# Returns parameter-specific response showing if username is injectable

# Backward compatible -- omitting parameter tests all params:
result = env.step(SecurityAuditAction(
    action_type="use_tool",
    tool_name="test_injection",
    arguments={"host": "10.0.1.10", "endpoint": "/api/login"}
))
```

### Custom Scenario Generation

```python
# Any string produces a unique, deterministic scenario:
result = env.reset(scenario_id="fintech-startup-2024")   # generates unique scenario
result = env.reset(scenario_id="healthcare-enterprise")   # different topology, different vulns
result = env.reset(scenario_id="easy")                    # built-in easy scenario

# Same ID always produces the same scenario (deterministic for benchmarking)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install openenv-core
cd security_audit_env
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

```python
from security_audit_env import SecurityAuditEnv, SecurityAuditAction

with SecurityAuditEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000").sync() as env:
    result = env.reset(scenario_id="easy")
    print(result.observation.message)

    result = env.step(SecurityAuditAction(action_type="list_tools"))
    result = env.step(SecurityAuditAction(
        action_type="use_tool",
        tool_name="network_scan",
        arguments={"target": "10.0.1.0/24"}
    ))
    print(result.observation.discovered_hosts)

    result = env.step(SecurityAuditAction(
        action_type="submit_finding",
        arguments={
            "title": "SQL Injection in /api/login",
            "host": "10.0.1.10",
            "type": "SQL Injection",
            "severity": "Critical",
            "cvss_score": 9.8,
            "cwe": "CWE-89",
            "owasp": "A03:2021 - Injection",
        }
    ))

    result = env.step(SecurityAuditAction(action_type="generate_report"))
    print(result.observation.tool_output)
```

## Action Space

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `list_tools` | See all available security audit tools |
| `use_tool` | Run a security tool (requires tool_name + arguments) |
| `submit_finding` | Document a discovered vulnerability |
| `spawn_subagent` | Delegate a divergent attack-surface branch (host / endpoint / cred) to a budgeted sub-agent |
| `return_to_parent` | Close the active sub-agent and resume the main thread |
| `generate_report` | End the audit and get the final score |

### Multi-Agent Delegation

During a real audit, an SSRF can disclose a previously-unreachable internal IP, a credential leak can open a new auth surface, etc. Tools emit a `[REVEALED] Sub-agent delegation candidates` block when their output expands the attack surface. The agent has a choice:

1. **Persist** on the main thread (safer when the current scope still has clear leads).
2. **Delegate** with `spawn_subagent({"scope": "host", "target": "10.0.2.30", "budget": 6})`. The next 6 steps are scoped to that branch — recon, test, submit findings on the new target — then the agent calls `return_to_parent` to resume the main investigation.

**Reward economics** (kept tight so spawning is a real decision, not a default):
- Productive sub-agent (≥ 1 finding submitted while active): **+0.05**
- Unproductive sub-agent (no findings, or budget exhausted empty-handed): **−0.05**
- Sub-agent's findings count toward the main grader; spawning is the delegation primitive, not a separate scoring path.

## Tasks

### Built-In Scenarios (3)

| ID | Name | Hosts | Vulns | Difficulty | Max Steps |
|----|------|-------|-------|------------|-----------|
| easy | Startup Web App Audit | 2 | 3 | Labeled output | 30 |
| medium | E-commerce Platform Audit | 4 (2 hidden) | 6 | Evidence-based output | 50 |
| hard | Enterprise SOC2 Pre-Audit | 6 (3 hidden) + honeypot | 10 | Raw HTTP output | 60 |

### Dynamic Scenarios (infinite)

Any string as scenario ID generates a unique, deterministic scenario. Difficulty is inferred from keywords in the ID:

| ID Contains | Difficulty | Hosts | Vulns | Honeypots |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "easy", "simple", "basic", "starter" | Easy | 2 | 3 | 0 |
| "medium", "moderate", "standard" | Medium | 3-5 | 5-7 | 0 |
| "hard", "enterprise", "advanced" | Hard | 5-8 | 8-12 | 1-2 |

## Tool Output Difficulty Tiers

The same tools produce different output detail depending on scenario difficulty:

| Difficulty | Tool Output Style | Agent Must... |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Easy | `[CRITICAL] SQL Injection DETECTED, CWE: CWE-89, CVSS: 9.8` | Read and submit the labeled finding |
| Medium | `[!] Anomalous response — server fetched internal URL via image_url parameter` | Classify the vulnerability type and assess severity |
| Hard | `Parameter: image_url=http://10.0.2.30:8080 -> HTTP 200, body: Jenkins HTML` | Infer SSRF from raw HTTP behavior, determine CWE-918, estimate CVSS |

This three-tier system ensures easy validates environment mechanics, medium tests classification ability, and hard genuinely challenges frontier model reasoning.

## Results: The Reasoning Gap

The headline finding of this environment is the **reasoning gap** — the difference in score between the labeled-output regime (easy) and the raw-evidence regime (hard). It separates pattern matching from genuine reasoning.

### Reproducible Baselines (deterministic + frontier LLM)

#### Deterministic Agent (no LLM, rule-based parser) — *fully reproducible*

| Scenario | Final Score | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Easy | **1.00** | Labeled output — regex parser matches perfectly |
| Medium | **0.07** | Evidence-based output — parser can't classify, only gets coverage |
| Hard | **0.00** | Raw output + honeypot penalty exceeds coverage score |

This baseline is grader-deterministic — running `python inference.py` against the live Space with the rule-based agent produces the same numbers every time. It's the floor.

#### LLM Agent (Gemini 2.5 Flash) — *reproducible with Gemini API key*

| Scenario | Final Score | Behavior |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Easy | **0.83** | Follows workflow, reads labeled output, submits findings correctly |
| Medium | **0.43** | Discovers hidden hosts, submits findings but struggles to classify from evidence |
| Hard | **0.27** | Finds some vulns but hits honeypot, limited classification from raw HTTP output |

The frontier-model curve already shows the gap: same vulnerabilities, same grader, **0.83 → 0.27** as evidence becomes raw. That delta of **0.56** is the reasoning gap a model has to close.

### How we got here — iteration journey

![Iteration journey: from raw baseline to GRPO-trained 6.4× lift](./plots/journey_progression.png)

*Average score across easy/medium/hard at each iteration. We started by benchmarking Llama 3.2 3B (0.26) and GPT-OSS-120B (0.28) to establish a frontier reference, then iterated on the multi-agent prompt (regression v1 → recovery v2), then ran real GRPO post-training to land at **0.482** — beating GPT-OSS-120B 1.7× with a model that's 40× smaller.*

### Models compared on the same env

![Models comparison: Llama 3.2 3B post-GRPO beats GPT-OSS-120B](./plots/models_comparison.png)

*Per-scenario final scores. Post-GRPO Llama 3.2 3B (teal) beats GPT-OSS-120B on every tier and the pre-training baseline by 5.7× on easy / 7.9× on medium. Hard stays at zero — that's the reasoning gap the env was designed to expose.*

### Multi-agent demo trace (medium scenario)

![Multi-agent trace: SSRF reveals hidden host -> spawn sub-agent -> RCE -> return](./plots/demo_multiagent.png)

*Step-by-step reward trace from `demo_multiagent.py` running against the live env. SSRF on `10.0.2.10/api/upload/image` reveals hidden host `10.0.2.30`, the agent **spawns a sub-agent** (shaded region), the sub-agent finds Jenkins RCE via `test_auth`, returns to parent, and the parent finishes with a final grader score of **0.60**.*

### GRPO Post-Training Results (real, this run)

We ran GRPO post-training (HF TRL + Unsloth, LoRA r=16) on Llama 3.2 3B against this env on a Colab T4. **Real W&B run:** [https://wandb.ai/sayujpillai63-itm/vapt-env-grpo/runs/ln2jq71s](https://wandb.ai/sayujpillai63-itm/vapt-env-grpo/runs/ln2jq71s) — 112 training steps, real reward + loss curves (no synthetic data).

![Performance comparison](./plots/performance_comparison.png)

*Llama 3.2 3B before vs after GRPO post-training, evaluated against the live HF Space env. Numbers are from the multi-component grader's `final_score`.*

| Scenario | Pre-training | Post-GRPO | Δ |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---|
| Easy | 0.150 | **0.855** | **+0.71 (5.7×)** |
| Medium | 0.075 | **0.590** | **+0.52 (7.9×)** |
| Hard | 0.000 | 0.000 | flat (unsolved) |
| **Average** | **0.075** | **0.482** | **+0.41 (6.4×)** |

![GRPO reward + loss curve](./plots/reward_per_episode.png)

*Real W&B reward (left) + loss (right) over 112 training steps. Reward climbs from ~0 to ~0.25 as the policy learns to use tools and submit findings.*

**Trained adapter:** [`Sayuj63/vapt-env-llama32-3b-grpo`](https://huggingface.co/Sayuj63/vapt-env-llama32-3b-grpo) on HF Hub — pull and re-evaluate yourself.

#### Evaluation harness disclosure

The post-training eval uses the canonical `inference.py` flow plus a small evaluation harness in [`colab_eval_v3.py`](./colab_eval_v3.py): a 3-step scripted recon prefix (network_scan → web_crawl → test_injection) + an anti-collapse safety net (rotates through endpoints when the trained policy emits `list_tools` ≥ 2× in a row) + evidence-driven finding submission (auto-submits when a `test_*` tool returns reward > 0.05, signalling the env confirmed a vuln). Trained Llama 3.2 3B drives the action-type selection inside this harness; the harness only fires when the env explicitly indicates a vulnerability is present. The harness is fully reproducible — see the script.

#### Why hard stays at zero

The hard scenario uses **raw HTTP output** with honeypots and progressive discovery — the trained 3B model + harness can find leads via `test_injection`/`vulnerability_scan` but cannot reliably interpret raw HTTP responses to attribute the right CWE without further training data. **This is the reasoning gap the env was designed to expose.** Frontier models (e.g. Gemini 2.5 Flash) score ~0.27 on hard; our env catches that small models cannot close this gap with 28 prompts × 2 epochs of GRPO alone.

### Reproduce These Numbers

Anyone with API access can verify the LLM baseline against the live Space in under five minutes:

```bash
# 1. Point the client at the live Space (no local install needed)
export ENV_URL="https://Sayuj63-Vapt-env.hf.space"

# 2. Pick any chat-completions API. Free OpenRouter Llama 3.2 3B works:
export API_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
export MODEL_NAME="meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free"
export HF_TOKEN="<your-openrouter-key>"

# 3. Run the LLM agent across easy / medium / hard
python inference.py
```

The script prints a per-scenario `REWARD / GRADER BREAKDOWN` block (final_score, true positives, coverage, false positives) so judges can see exactly what the grader rewarded.

To reproduce the post-training curve yourself on Colab T4 (~2 hours, free tier):

```bash
# Open AISHA_RL_Training_Colab.ipynb in Google Colab → Runtime: T4 GPU → Run all
# Output: trained adapter + W&B run + updated plots/*.png
```

## Scoring

Multi-dimensional grading (0.0-1.0):

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Detection Rate | 30% | Vulnerabilities correctly identified out of total |
| Severity Accuracy (CVSS) | 20% | Precision of CVSS score estimates |
| Classification (CWE + OWASP) | 15% | 70% CWE exact match + 30% OWASP category match |
| Report Quality | 10% | 60% field completeness (9 fields) + 40% narrative quality |
| Coverage | 5% | Percentage of non-honeypot hosts examined |
| Pivoting Score | 5% | Found gateway vulns that unlock hidden hosts |
| Exploitation Proof | 5% | Proportional: `true_positives / total_vulnerabilities` |
| Compliance Coverage | 5% | Fraction of compliance controls addressed (PCI-DSS/SOC2/HIPAA) |
| Delegation Score | 5% | `productive_spawns / total_spawns` — quality of multi-agent delegation decisions (1.0 if no spawns, neutral) |
| False Positive Penalty | escalating | -0.03 first, +0.01 per additional FP (caps at -0.08 each) |
| Honeypot Penalty | -15% each | Interacting with decoy hosts reduces score |
| Coverage < 50% | multiplier | `0.7 + 0.6 * coverage` applied to raw score |

## Reward Function

Dense per-step rewards designed for RL post-training:

| Action | Reward | Signal |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Discover new host | +0.05 | Encourages exploration |
| Find vulnerability evidence | +0.08 | Rewards tool usage |
| Submit correct finding | +0.12 | Rewards accurate reporting |
| Submit unmatched finding | +0.02 (diminishing) | Prevents finding spam |
| Touch honeypot | -0.10 | Penalizes carelessness |
| Redundant tool call | -0.01 | Prevents loops |
| Final report | 0.0-1.0 | Comprehensive episode grade |

Difficulty-scaled multipliers: easy 1.0x, medium 1.3x, hard 1.6x.

Key research validating our design:
- **ARTEMIS** (arXiv:2512.09882): First live enterprise AI vs human pentest -- AI has high FP rates. Our escalating FP penalty and honeypot system directly address this.
- **MAPTA** (arXiv:2508.20816): Multi-agent pentesting achieves 76.9% on SSRF/misconfig but 0% on blind SQLi -- our three-tier output tests exactly this reasoning gap.
- **Reward Machines** (arXiv:2405.15908): Phase-decomposed rewards accelerate RL training -- our environment tracks audit phases (reconnaissance -> enumeration -> exploitation -> reporting).
